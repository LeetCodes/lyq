Lyq: Leak Your Query - version 0.8

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
Lyq (Leak Your Query) is the world smallest micro blogging tool that tweets
(leaks) what you've searched automatically. Do NOT use this extension unless
you know what you are doing with it. You will face serious security risks.

Lyq extracts a search query from the following search services and tweets it
with a shortened link to that page. You can disable tweeting by the toggle
button displayed besides the location bar.

Supported Search Services
-------------------------
* Google web, images, videos, news
* Bing web, images,videos, news
* YouTube
* Nico Nico Douga

WARNINGS
========
Lyq may leak any hidden URLs. Some web services achieve privacy protection by
hiding URLs and it is expected that you do not disclose them (e.g. Google
Calendar and Google Maps).


INSTALL

Currently Lyq does not provide a compound package, that means it is not able
to install Lyq from web. Instead, follow these steps:

   in the location bar.
3. Click "Load unpackaged extension..." button.
4. When a file dialog is opened, choose a directory contains Lyq's files.

This installing process is needed again when you restart Chrome. Sorry for your
inconvenience.

After the first installing of Lyq, open the configuration page by clicking
"Option" button from the Extensions page, and set your twitter account.
(Currently Lyq uses Basic authentication, which is not recommended by twitter.)
