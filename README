Lyq: Leak Your Query - version 1.1

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
Lyq (Leak Your Query) is the world smallest micro blogging tool that tweets
(leaks) what you've searched automatically. Do NOT use this extension unless
you know what you are doing with it. You will face serious security risks.


Supported Search Services
-------------------------
Lyq extracts a search query from the following search services:

* Google web, images, videos, news, maps (experimental)
* Bing web, images,videos, news, maps (experimental)
* YouTube
* Nico Nico Douga


USAGE
=====
By clicking the icon next to the address bar, you can turn on/off Lyq. When
it is turned on, it tweets your search query.

Optionally you can add a hashtag and/or a shorten URL to the search result.
Go Options page to enable them. To open the options page, right click on
the Lyq's icon or select Extensions from Tools menu.


WARNINGS
========
Lyq may leak any hidden URLs. Some web services achieve privacy protection by
hiding URLs and it is expected that you do not disclose them (e.g. Google
Calendar and Google Maps).
