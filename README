Lyq: Leak Your Query - version 1.4

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
Lyq (Leak Your Query, pronounced as leak) is a micro "unintentional" blogging
tool that tweets (leaks) what you've searched automatically. It is a Google
Chrome Extension, and after you've installed Lyq, it discloses your search
query every your search query at various search services such as Google or Bing.
Everyone can know what information you needed, where you wanted to go, or what
you thought, that previously only your search services could know.

Do NOT use this extension unless you know what you are doing with it. You will
face serious security risks.

Supported Search Services
-------------------------
Lyq extracts a search query from the following search services:

* Google web, images, videos, news, maps (experimental)
* Bing web, images,videos, news, maps (experimental)
* YouTube
* Nico Nico Douga

USAGE
=====
The Lyq icon next to the address bar works as a toggle switch and you can turn
on/off Lyq by clicking it. When it is turned on, it tweets your search query.

Optionally you can add a hashtag and/or a shorten URL to the search result.
Go Options page to enable them. To open the options page, right click on
the Lyq's icon or select Extensions from Tools menu.

WARNINGS

Lyq may leak any hidden URLs. Some web services achieve privacy protection by
hiding URLs and it is expected that you do not disclose them (e.g. Google
Calendar and Google Maps).
